The Developer hereby, authorizes Company to engage and appoint such Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data, as well as permits each Sub-Processor to appoint a Sub Processor on its behalf. Company may replace its existing Sub-Processors or add additional Sub-Processors provided it notifies the Developer before authorizing such Sub-Processor(s) to Process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Services (email will suffice). Developer may reasonably object to the use of a new Sub-Processor by notifying Company promptly in writing within 10 days after receipt of Company’s notice. Developer shall explain its reasonable grounds for objection. In the event Developer objects to a new Sub-processor, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Developer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Developer’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening Developer. If Company is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, either party may terminate without penalty with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Company without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to the other party. Where Company engages a Sub-Processor, it shall impose on the Sub-Processor data protection obligations no less onerous than those set out in this DPA, through a legally binding contract between Company and the Sub-Processor (“Contract”). Company shall ensure that the Contract will require the Sub-Processor to provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the Processing will meet the requirements of Data Protection Law. 5.3.   Company shall remain fully responsible to the Developer for the performance of the Sub-Processor’s obligations in accordance with the DPA. Company shall notify the Developer of any known failure by the Sub-Processor to fulfill its contractual obligations.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>DATA TRANSFER</strong></p><ol><li><p>Any transfer of Personal Data Processed in connection with the Agreement outside of the jurisdiction from which it was collected shall be transferred subject to and in compliance with an approved transfer mechanism.</p></li><li><p>Personal Data may be transferred from the EU Member States, the three EEA member countries (Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), and the United Kingdom (collectively, “EEA”) to Adequate Country, without any further safeguard being necessary.</p></li><li><p>If the transfers of Personal Data include transfers from the EEA to countries that are not Adequate Country, then parties agree to rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate such transfer:</p><ol><li><p>Transfer of Personal Data from the EEA The terms set forth in <strong>ANNEX III</strong> shall apply. </p></li><li><p>Transfer of Personal Data from the UK, the terms set forth in <strong>ANNEX IV</strong> shall apply; and </p></li><li><p>Transfer of Personal Data from Switzerland, the terms set forth in <strong>ANNEX V</strong> shall apply. </p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>CONFLICT</strong></p><ol><li>In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA shall prevail.
