reasonable control (such as interruptions or failures), or

Application on the Platform. Overwolf reserves the right to suspend or ban any
Application or Developer from Overwolf. If your Application is rejected, removed,
or suspended from the Platform then Overwolf may withhold payments due to the Developer.

<!-- -->PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES
WITH OVERWOLF AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM OVERWOLF,
INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p><ol><li><p>You agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or
may arise between you and Overwolf relating in any way to or arising out
of these Terms or your use of or access to the Platform will be resolved
in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section (15.6).</p></li><li><p>You and Overwolf will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal
negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date the notice of dispute
is sent. That notice should contain proof of your relationship with Overwolf,
the nature and legal basis for your or Overwolf&#x27;s dispute, and an individual
monetary demand if you or we are seeking such relief. During this period,
the parties shall use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim or disagreement.
If the dispute is not resolved within such time period, you agree that any
and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and
Overwolf relating in any way to or arising out of these Terms or your use
of or access to the Platform shall be resolved exclusively through final
and binding arbitration.</p></li><li><p>You agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an
individual basis and individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class
member in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general
action whether in arbitration or litigation, and the parties expressly waive
their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. The arbitrator
may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief)
only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party&#x27;s individual claim.
Any relief awarded cannot affect other Overwolf users.</p></li><li><p>In all events, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally,
waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any right it may have
to a trial by jury of any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms
or your use of or access to the Platform.</p></li><li><p>If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of
this paragraph&#x27;s prohibitions on class, representative, or private attorney
general actions or proceedings as to any claim, then that claim (and only
that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and resolved in court,
subject to your and Overwolf&#x27;s right to appeal the court&#x27;s decision. All
other claims will be arbitrated.</p></li><li><p>The arbitration shall be held in Tel Aviv, Israel (or at another mutually
agreed upon location). The Israeli Arbitration Law, 5728-1968 shall govern
the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.
The arbitration will be conducted by the Israeli Institute of Commercial
Arbitration, under their rules and procedures as applicable, including the
commercial arbitration rules, as modified by this agreement.</p></li><li><p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or dispute under
these Terms and related to your access or use of the Platform must be filed
within one (1) year from the date of the cause of action. If a claim or dispute
is not filed within one year, you acknowledge that you shall have waived
and will be deemed permanently barred from bringing such dispute.</p></li><li><p>With the exception of any of the provisions in the class action waiver,
if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate
is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate
shall still apply. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable
law precludes enforcement of this Section&#x27;s limitations as to a particular remedy,
then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration
and may be sought in court.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property</strong>: Notwithstanding the
parties&#x27; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, Overwolf may
bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property
rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights,
trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).</p></li><li><p><strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out of Arbitration</strong>: You have the right to
opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration clause by sending written
notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: <a href="mailto:developers@overwolf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers@overwolf.com</a>
The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Platform,
whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in
accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of arbitration,
Overwolf also will not be bound to arbitrate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Judicial Forum for Disputes</strong>: Except as otherwise required by
applicable law or provided in this Section (15.6), in the event that the
agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and
Overwolf agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a court
of competent jurisdiction in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel. Both you and Overwolf
consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Governing Law</strong>.</p><ol><li><p>These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the
laws of Israel excluding that body of law pertaining to conflict of laws.
Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought
exclusively in courts located in Israel and the parties hereby irrevocably
consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein. You agree that these
Terms and the rules, restrictions, and policies contained herein, and Overwolf&#x27;s
enforcement thereof, are not intended to confer and do not confer any rights
or remedies on any person other than you and Overwolf.</p></li><li><p>These Terms and any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out
of or in connection with them will be governed as stated herein provided
that this choice of governing law will not deprive you of the protection
afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement
by virtue of the laws applicable where you habitually reside. In such cases,
disputes shall be resolved in the competent civil courts as determined by applicable law.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Assignment; Successors.</strong> Developer shall not assign any of its rights
